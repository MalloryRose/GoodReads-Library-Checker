## Known Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Technical Limitations
1. **Library Website Changes**: HTML structure changes may break scrapers
   - **Mitigation**: Robust parsing with multiple fallback strategies
   - **Status**: Monitored and updated as needed

2. **Rate Limiting**: Some library servers may have strict rate limits
   - **Mitigation**: Configurable delays and conservative default settings
   - **Status**: Working well with current settings

3. **Memory Usage**: WebDriver instances use significant RAM
   - **Mitigation**: Configurable pool size and automatic cleanup
   - **Status**: Acceptable for typical use cases

4. **Network Reliability**: Library servers may be slow or unreliable
   - **Mitigation**: Timeout handling and retry logic
   - **Status**: Robust error handling in place

### User Experience Limitations
1. **Setup Complexity**: ChromeDriver installation required
   - **Mitigation**: Clear installation instructions
   - **Status**: Documented but could be simplified

2. **Limited Library Support**: Only two library systems currently supported
   - **Mitigation**: Modular architecture makes adding new systems straightforward
   - **Status**: Framework ready for expansion

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Selenium vs Requests**: Chose Selenium for JavaScript-heavy library catalogs
   - **Rationale**: Library catalogs often require JavaScript execution
   - **Result**: Better compatibility but higher resource usage

2. **Multithreading vs Multiprocessing**: Chose multithreading for I/O-bound operations
   - **Rationale**: Simpler resource management and sufficient performance
   - **Result**: Good performance with manageable complexity

3. **GUI Framework**: Chose tkinter for cross-platform compatibility
   - **Rationale**: Built into Python, no additional dependencies
   - **Result**: Works well across all platforms

### Performance Decisions
1. **Thread Pool Size**: Default of 3 workers
   - **Rationale**: Balance between speed and server load
   - **Result**: Good performance without overwhelming servers

2. **Rate Limiting**: 1-second minimum delay between requests
   - **Rationale**: Respectful to library servers
   - **Result**: Reliable operation without server issues

3. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with error results
   - **Rationale**: Individual failures shouldn't crash the system
   - **Result**: Robust operation even with network issues

### User Experience Decisions
1. **Dual Interface**: Both CLI and GUI options
   - **Rationale**: Different users have different preferences
   - **Result**: Accessible to both technical and non-technical users

2. **Real-Time Updates**: Queue-based communication for GUI updates
   - **Rationale**: Responsive user experience
   - **Result**: Users can see progress and results immediately

3. **JSON Output**: Structured data format
   - **Rationale**: Easy to parse and integrate with other tools
   - **Result**: Flexible output for various use cases
