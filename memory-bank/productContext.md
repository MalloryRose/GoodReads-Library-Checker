# Product Context: GoodReads Library Checker

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Book lovers often maintain extensive "Want to Read" lists on Goodreads, but discovering which books are available at their local libraries requires manual checking of multiple library catalogs. This is time-consuming and inefficient, especially when dealing with large reading lists.

### The Solution
An automated tool that bridges the gap between Goodreads reading lists and local library availability, making it easy to discover which books from your reading list are available for borrowing.

## Problems It Solves

### For Book Readers
1. **Time Savings**: Eliminates manual checking of multiple library catalogs
2. **Discovery**: Helps users find books they want to read that are actually available
3. **Efficiency**: Batch processing of entire reading lists
4. **Accessibility**: Makes library resources more discoverable

### For Libraries
1. **Increased Usage**: Encourages patrons to use library resources
2. **Better Resource Utilization**: Helps patrons discover available materials
3. **Modern Interface**: Provides a contemporary way to interact with library catalogs

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow
1. **Export from Goodreads**: User exports their "Want to Read" list as CSV
2. **Select Library System**: Choose between Palm Beach County or Alachua County libraries
3. **Run Check**: Tool processes the list and checks availability
4. **View Results**: See which books are available and at which branches
5. **Take Action**: Visit library website to place holds or check out books
