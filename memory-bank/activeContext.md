# Active Context: GoodReads Library Checker

## Current Work Focus

### Project Status
The GoodReads Library Checker is a **functional Python application** that successfully checks book availability across multiple library systems. The core functionality is complete and working.

### Current State
- ✅ **Core Scraping Engine**: Multithreaded library availability checking
- ✅ **Multi-Library Support**: Palm Beach County and Alachua County libraries
- ✅ **GUI Interface**: User-friendly tkinter-based interface
- ✅ **Data Processing**: Goodreads CSV import and JSON export
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and recovery
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Server-friendly request patterns
- ✅ **Branch Filtering**: New dropdown filter to filter results by library branch

### Recent Changes
Based on the project structure and data files, the system has been successfully implemented with:
- Threaded scraping capabilities (`library_scraper_threaded.py`)
- GUI interface (`GUI.py`) with new branch filtering feature
- Test data and results (`data/Alachua_availability.json`)
- Comprehensive documentation (`README.md`)

**Latest Enhancement**: Added branch filter dropdown to GUI that allows users to filter results by specific library branches after receiving search results.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Memory Bank Initialization**: Complete the memory bank setup (current task)
2. **Documentation Review**: Ensure all documentation is up to date
3. **Code Quality Check**: Review for any potential improvements
4. **Testing Verification**: Confirm all functionality works as expected

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Additional Library Systems**: Support for more library catalogs
2. **Email Notifications**: Alert users when books become available
3. **Scheduling**: Automated periodic checks
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Additional filtering options (format, availability status)
5. **Export Formats**: Additional export options (Excel, PDF)

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Selenium WebDriver**: Chosen for JavaScript-heavy library catalogs
2. **Multithreading**: ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrent processing
3. **Rate Limiting**: Per-thread minimum delays to respect servers
4. **GUI Framework**: tkinter for cross-platform compatibility
5. **Data Format**: JSON for structured output and easy parsing
6. **Branch Filtering**: Dropdown-based filtering with real-time updates

### Current Architecture Preferences
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation between scraping, GUI, and data layers
- **Thread Safety**: Proper resource management and locking
- **Error Resilience**: Individual failures don't crash the system
- **User Experience**: Both CLI and GUI interfaces available
- **Interactive Filtering**: Real-time filtering with immediate visual feedback

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- **Class-based Architecture**: Clear object-oriented structure
- **Abstract Base Classes**: `LibraryScraperBase` for extensibility
- **Data Classes**: `Book` and result classes for type safety
- **Thread Pool Management**: `ThreadSafeSeleniumPool` for resource management
- **Filter Management**: Separate methods for filtering logic and display updates

### Error Handling Patterns
- **Graceful Degradation**: Individual book failures don't affect others
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed error information for debugging
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear error messages in GUI
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatic retry and fallback strategies

### Performance Patterns
- **Configurable Threading**: Adjustable worker count for different systems
- **Rate Limiting**: Server-friendly request patterns
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup of WebDriver instances
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reusable components and proper cleanup
- **Efficient Filtering**: Real-time filtering without performance impact

## Project Insights

### What Works Well
1. **Multithreaded Processing**: Significantly faster than sequential processing
2. **Modular Architecture**: Easy to add new library systems
3. **Robust Error Handling**: System continues working even with individual failures
4. **User-Friendly GUI**: Intuitive interface for non-technical users
5. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear setup and usage instructions
6. **Branch Filtering**: Users can easily find books at specific library branches

### Key Learnings
1. **Library Catalog Diversity**: Different systems require different scraping strategies
2. **Rate Limiting Importance**: Essential for maintaining good relationships with library servers
3. **Thread Safety Complexity**: WebDriver management requires careful attention
4. **Error Recovery**: Individual book failures are common and must be handled gracefully
5. **User Experience**: GUI makes the tool accessible to non-technical users
6. **Filtering UX**: Real-time filtering with immediate feedback improves user experience

### Technical Challenges Solved
1. **JavaScript-Heavy Sites**: Selenium WebDriver handles dynamic content
2. **Concurrent Access**: Thread-safe WebDriver pool management
3. **Network Reliability**: Timeout handling and retry logic
4. **Data Parsing**: Robust HTML parsing with multiple fallback strategies
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: tkinter GUI works across operating systems
6. **Dynamic Filtering**: Real-time filtering with proper state management
