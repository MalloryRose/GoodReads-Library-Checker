Updates to be made:

- GUI is very slow
- Save the data as you scrape
- Record requests which returned errors somewhere to retry them. Automate this.
- Obtaining format (E-book, audiobook, etc)
- Memory Management:
        For large book lists, consider:

        Implementing batch processing
        Adding memory usage monitoring
        Clearing cached data periodically
